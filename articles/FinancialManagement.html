             <p class="text-muted lead">
              Some of our youth today , in this era of advanced  technology, fallen prey to these super crazy lifestyles giving into drug addition , alcoholism and wasting their lives under those flashing neon lights because of their poor financial management.Just as sun radiates its bright light to the world , so shall youth attain "financial management" and are called not to put a burden on their loving parents but to lead a successful life.
           </p>

           <p class="text-muted lead">
              I encourage youth to lead a successful life , to be well organized by following this constructive financial management in accordance to one's age group and I humbly dedicate to the entire youth.
          </p>
         
          <p class="text-muted lead">"True meaning of a victory is to Win day-by-day". Just saying to yourself  "I know everything" doesn't help, in fact one must say that "I should be learning more and more and more...". With this kind of attitude on a daily note , there is nothing, in this world , impossible to achieve"</p>  

          <p class="text-muted lead">Having said that , I'd like to  dedicate this book to all the youth and their beloved parents.
              I'd like to thank all my friends who encouraged me to write this book in every means of ways.
              My special thanks to my beloved wife , my lovely daughter and my wonderful parents.

          <p class="text-muted lead"> 
          If any of the content in this book is discouraging and you feel disrespected, please forgive me.
          Everyone in this world has at least one 'good-element' in them by nature.  However, in certain cases , things will go wrong prompting humans to focus on 'improper expenditure" leading them in  bad direction and sometime make them into their habits. </p>

          <p class="text-muted lead">A 'bad element' of our nature can be overcome d by reading a good book or sometimes by meeting great people and making friends with them. Therefore the result is a stream of  'good elements' flowing inside of us.</p>

          <p class="text-muted lead"> In this developing country, India , youth still think "It's already in developing stage" but its not the case.</p>
          <p class="text-muted lead">It almost surprises me when leading publishers and news agencies say that there are only about 100 people who are crorepatis ( Millionaires). In a country whose population is over 120 crores out of which only 100 people are millionaires which means out of every 12 Crores people only one comes out as a crorepati (Millionaire )  </p>
          <p class="text-muted lead"> youth today are still accustomed to standard lifestyle like earning a Degree until you are 21 and then Post Graduation (PG) , then Job, and then monthly salaries , marriage , Kids. I mean , I can't just say how much of a bank balance does a youth have especially at age 21 or say how much of earnings they do..but, sadly it would be way too low :( </p>
          <p class="text-muted lead"> 
          All this is because of lack of "Financial Management" ! We the youth today spend hours and hours on 'Facebook', 'WhatsApp' ,'Twitter' etc., effecting 
          our own country's "Financial Development" because of our poor "Financial management".  </p>
<h1 class="text-muted lead">All I want to appeal is for this equation </h1>

                This is being shown to you in a chronological order and yes, if you like this approach , you are encouraged to follow this method which will be of your help and support in the time of needs.</p>
             <p class="text-muted lead">Please do not consider only just the above shown 3 primary "wasteful expenditures". In every expenditure , there always  lies a "Wasteful" expenditure. If one can manage to save even the 10% of "useless" expenditures, life becomes easier after some years goes by.
              </p>
             <p class="text-muted lead">If parents teach their children on "financial management" after they are fully grown up, then definitely kids won't be able to learn the importance of money. However, it is advised that parents teach their kids when they are still young and kids will at least appreciate the importance of hard earned money of their parents and value them.

            </p>
            <p class="text-muted lead">The most important point to be noted here is this,</p> <blockquote class="text-muted lead"> A person has every right to spend money if he is equally saving, however , on the other hand, one definitely has no rights to spend a penny if he is not saving any

            <p class="text-muted lead">I'd encourage youth not to give priority to "spending" before you have enough "savings". If not, I am afraid , you'll become a burden to your parents financially ! 
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted lead">In this generation where an actor's son becomes an actor , an actress' daughter an actress , a business man's son inherits his fathers assets ! All this is because of our thinking ! If we encourage them ( celebrities ) ,I bet we'd not get any appreciation back but instead they ( celebrities ) will encourage their own kids in their growth only and care less about us.
